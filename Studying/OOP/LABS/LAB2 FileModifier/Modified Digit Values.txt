Digital values. Each digit in a number system represents an integer. For example, in decimal the digit "1" represents the integer one, and in the hexadecimal system, the letter "A" represents the number ten. A positional number system has one unique digit for each integer from zero up to, but not including, the radix of the number system. Thus in the positional decimal system, the numbers 0 to 9 can be expressed using their respective numerals "0" to "9" in the rightmost "units" position. The number 12 can be expressed with the numeral "2" in the units position, and with the numeral "1" in the "tens" position, to the left of the "2" while the number 312 can be expressed by three numerals: "3" in the "hundreds" position, "1" in the "tens" position, and "2" in the "units" position.

Digital Values. Each Digit In A Number System Represents An Integer. For Example, In Decimal The Digit "1" Represents The Integer One, And In The Hexadecimal System, The Letter "A" Represents The Number Ten. A Positional Number System Has One Unique Digit For Each Integer From Zero Up To, But Not Including, The Radix Of The Number System. Thus In The Positional Decimal System, The Numbers 0 To 9 Can Be Expressed Using Their Respective Numerals "0" To "9" In The Rightmost "units" Position. The Number 12 Can Be Expressed With The Numeral "2" In The Units Position, And With The Numeral "1" In The "tens" Position, To The Left Of The "2" While The Number 312 Can Be Expressed By Three Numerals: "3" In The "hundreds" Position, "1" In The "tens" Position, And "2" In The "units" Position.

Digital VALUES. Each DIGIT in A number SYSTEM represents AN integer. FOR example, IN decimal THE digit "1" represents THE integer ONE, and IN the HEXADECIMAL system, THE letter "A" represents THE number TEN. A POSITIONAL number SYSTEM has ONE unique DIGIT for EACH integer FROM zero UP to, BUT not INCLUDING, the RADIX of THE number SYSTEM. Thus IN the POSITIONAL decimal SYSTEM, the NUMBERS 0 TO 9 CAN be EXPRESSED using THEIR respective NUMERALS "0" TO "9" IN the RIGHTMOST "units" POSITION. The NUMBER 12 CAN be EXPRESSED with THE numeral "2" in THE units POSITION, and WITH the NUMERAL "1" IN the "TENS" position, TO the LEFT of THE "2" WHILE the NUMBER 312 CAN be EXPRESSED by THREE numerals: "3" in THE "hundreds" POSITION, "1" IN the "TENS" position, AND "2" IN the "UNITS" position.

Digital values. Each digit in a number system represents an integer. For example, in decimal the digit "ONE" represents the integer one, and in the hexadecimal system, the letter "A" represents the number ten. A positional number system has one unique digit for each integer from zero up to, but not including, the radix of the number system. Thus in the positional decimal system, the numbers ZERO to NINE can be expressed using their respective numerals "ZERO" to "NINE" in the rightmost "units" position. The number ONETWO can be expressed with the numeral "TWO" in the units position, and with the numeral "ONE" in the "tens" position, to the left of the "TWO" while the number THREEONETWO can be expressed by three numerals: "THREE" in the "hundreds" position, "ONE" in the "tens" position, and "TWO" in the "units" position.
