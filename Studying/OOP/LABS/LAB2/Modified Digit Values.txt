Digital values. Each digit in a number system represents an integer. For example, in decimal the digit "1" represents the integer one, and in the hexadecimal system, the letter "A" represents the number ten. A positional number system has one unique digit for each integer from zero up to, but not including, the radix of the number system. Thus in the positional decimal system, the numbers 0 to 9 can be expressed using their respective numerals "0" to "9" in the rightmost "units" position. The number 12 can be expressed with the numeral "2" in the units position, and with the numeral "1" in the "tens" position, to the left of the "2" while the number 312 can be expressed by three numerals: "3" in the "hundreds" position, "1" in the "tens" position, and "2" in the "units" position.

values.
Each
digit
in
a
number
system
represents
an
integer.
For
example,
in
decimal
the
digit
"1"
represents
the
integer
one,
and
in
the
hexadecimal
system,
the
letter
"A"
represents
the
number
ten.
A
positional
number
system
has
one
unique
digit
for
each
integer
from
zero
up
to,
but
not
including,
the
radix
of
the
number
system.
Thus
in
the
positional
decimal
system,
the
numbers
0
to
9
can
be
expressed
using
their
respective
numerals
"0"
to
"9"
in
the
rightmost
"units"
position.
The
number
12
can
be
expressed
with
the
numeral
"2"
in
the
units
position,
and
with
the
numeral
"1"
in
the
"tens"
position,
to
the
left
of
the
"2"
while
the
number
312
can
be
expressed
by
three
numerals:
"3"
in
the
"hundreds"
position,
"1"
in
the
"tens"
position,
and
"2"
in
the

Digital Values. Each Digit In A Number System Represents An Integer. For Example, In Decimal The Digit "1" Represents The Integer One, And In The Hexadecimal System, The Letter "A" Represents The Number Ten. A Positional Number System Has One Unique Digit For Each Integer From Zero Up To, But Not Including, The Radix Of The Number System. Thus In The Positional Decimal System, The Numbers 0 To 9 Can Be Expressed Using Their Respective Numerals "0" To "9" In The Rightmost "units" Position. The Number 12 Can Be Expressed With The Numeral "2" In The Units Position, And With The Numeral "1" In The "tens" Position, To The Left Of The "2" While The Number 312 Can Be Expressed By Three Numerals: "3" In The "hundreds" Position, "1" In The "tens" Position, And "2" In The "units" Position.

Digital VALUES. Each DIGIT in A number SYSTEM represents AN integer. FOR example, IN decimal THE digit "1" represents THE integer ONE, and IN the HEXADECIMAL system, THE letter "A" represents THE number TEN. A POSITIONAL number SYSTEM has ONE unique DIGIT for EACH integer FROM zero UP to, BUT not INCLUDING, the RADIX of THE number SYSTEM. Thus IN the POSITIONAL decimal SYSTEM, the NUMBERS 0 TO 9 CAN be EXPRESSED using THEIR respective NUMERALS "0" TO "9" IN the RIGHTMOST "units" POSITION. The NUMBER 12 CAN be EXPRESSED with THE numeral "2" in THE units POSITION, and WITH the NUMERAL "1" IN the "TENS" position, TO the LEFT of THE "2" WHILE the NUMBER 312 CAN be EXPRESSED by THREE numerals: "3" in THE "hundreds" POSITION, "1" IN the "TENS" position, AND "2" IN the "UNITS" position.
